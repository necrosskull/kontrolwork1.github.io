	THE INTERNET
</p>
<p>
	how does the internet work? The best way to transmit data is through a fiber optic network, which connects the data center and your device with a fiber optic cable. In the data center we can find a server, inside the server there is an SSD, all the information is stored on the SSD disk.
	<br />
	We get data to our devices using IP addresses, specific numbers of a particular device on the network. But people use domains instead of IP addresses for easy recall.
	<br />
	There is DNS to store domains and IP addresses, if we know the domain, we can find IP addresses in it.
	<br />
	The distribution of IP addresses is handled by ICANN. Information is transmitted in packets, each packet taking up 6 bits.
	<br />
	The whole Internet can be compared to a postal network.
	<br />
	There is another way - the use of satellites. But this is not the best way to transmit data, because due to the long distance, there is a strong signal delay as the data compared to cables
