<p class="topic-paragraph">A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or<span>&nbsp;</span>binary<span>&nbsp;</span>digits (&ldquo;bits&rdquo;), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.</p>

<p class="topic-paragraph">The first important algorithmic language was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/FORTRAN" class="md-crosslink">FORTRAN</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(<em>for</em>mula<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tran</em>slation), designed in 1957 by an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">IBM</a><span>&nbsp;</span>team led by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Warner-Backus" class="md-crosslink">John Backus</a>. It was intended for scientific computations with<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/real-number" class="md-crosslink">real numbers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and collections of them organized as one- or multidimensional arrays.</p>

<h2 class="h3"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/C-computer-programming-language" class="md-crosslink">C</a></h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">The C programming language was developed in 1972 by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dennis-M-Ritchie" class="md-crosslink">Dennis Ritchie</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and Brian Kernighan at the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ATandT-Corporation" class="md-crosslink">AT&amp;T Corporation</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for programming computer<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system" class="md-crosslink">operating systems</a>. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="composition" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition" data-type="MW">composition</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/systems-programming" class="md-crosslink autoxref">systems programming</a>, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer&rsquo;s internal architecture. C, along with its descendant<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/C-computer-language" class="md-crosslink autoxref">C++</a>, remains one of the most common languages.</p>

<h2 class="h3"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Pascal-computer-language" class="md-crosslink">Pascal</a></h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">About 1970<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niklaus-Emil-Wirth" class="md-crosslink">Niklaus Wirth</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland" class="md-crosslink">Switzerland</a><span>&nbsp;</span>designed<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Pascal-computer-language" class="md-crosslink">Pascal</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to teach structured programming, which<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="emphasized" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/emphasized" data-type="EB">emphasized</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the orderly use of conditional and loop control structures without GOTO statements. Although Pascal resembled<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ALGOL-computer-language" class="md-crosslink autoxref">ALGOL</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in notation, it provided the ability to define data types with which to organize complex information, a feature beyond the capabilities of ALGOL as well as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/FORTRAN" class="md-crosslink autoxref">FORTRAN</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/COBOL" class="md-crosslink autoxref">COBOL</a>. User-defined data types allowed the programmer to introduce names for complex data, which the language translator could then check for correct usage before running a program.</p>
