		Main things to protect your computer
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Control Access to Hardware and Software:
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Lock physical locations and equipment.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Install a physical security system.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Monitor access 24 hours a day.
	</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<span>
		Implement Network Controls
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Install firewalls to protect networks from external and internal attacks.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Password-protect programs and data with passwords which cannot easily be cracked.
	</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<span>
		Protect against Natural Disasters
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Install uninterruptible power supplies and surge protectors
	</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<span>
		Backup Data and Programs
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Separate and Rotate Functions
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Protect against Viruses
	</span>
	<br />

		Near-line and offline storage (often called Hierarchical Storage Management) is the modern way of dealing with current storage needs. HSM is essentially the automatic movement of data between media, the media type used depending on when it was last accessed.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		The most common HSM setup is where there's online storage (the hard disk), near-line storage (some sort of fast media from where a file can be quickly retrieved), and offline storage (slower media that might take some time for files to be recovered, but it is cheaper for a long-term storage).
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		The cheapest is undoubtedly tape (be it digital, analogue or digital linear), so this tends to be used for offline storage. However, tape has no guarantee of data integrity beyond one or two years, whereas optical systems, such CDs, WORMS and MO disks, have much better data integrity over a longer period of time. Depending on the precise application, archiving systems are usually based on the media type that has the best integrity.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Tape is used for backup systems where large amounts of data need to be backed up on a regular basis. Tape is cheap, integrity is good over the short to medium term, and retrieval from a backup can be made acceptable with good tape storage practices.
	</span>
	<br />
	<span>
		Near-line storage should be based on erasable optical disks. This is because access is random, so the access speed to find and retrieve a particular file needs to be fast, and data integrity 0 is also good.
	</span>
	<br />
	<br />
	<span>
		Archiving systems should probably be CD- or WORM-based, as again access speeds are good, media costs are reasonably cheap and, importantly, the integrity of the media over the medium to long term is good. One important thing to remember with archiving systems is the stored data's format. The data might be held perfectly for 10 or 15 140 ut when you need to get it back, it's essentiai that you maintain appropriate hardware and software to enable you to read it&nbsp;
